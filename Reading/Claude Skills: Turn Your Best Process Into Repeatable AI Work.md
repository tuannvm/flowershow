**Claude Skills: Turn Your Best Process Into Repeatable AI Work**  
https://intelligencebyintent.substack.com/p/claude-skills-turn-your-best-process

Claude Skills are a new feature by Anthropic that allows teams to convert their most effective workflows into reusable, structured AI instructions. Instead of relying on lengthy prompts or constant retraining, Skills store company procedures in small folders with instructions, reference files, and optional scripts. When prompted, Claude automatically selects the right skill and delivers consistent, on-brand results.  

**Key Points:**

- **What Claude Skills Are:**  
  - Self-contained instruction sets capturing how your organization performs tasks.  
  - Include step-by-step instructions, supporting documents, and optional code for deterministic outputs.  
  - Can be created by non-technical staff in minutes and reused across Claude’s apps, IDE, and API.

- **Benefits:**  
  - Delivers consistent, repeatable outputs without “heroic” prompts.  
  - Reduces time, errors, and token waste by keeping bulky references outside the chat.  
  - Converts organizational knowledge into scalable, standardized processes.  

- **Use Cases:**  
  - Client proposals that automatically follow pricing and slide templates.  
  - Quarterly business review (QBR) packs that pull the same metrics reliably.  
  - Legal intake processes that ensure conflict checks and structured briefs.  

- **Risks and Considerations:**  
  - Skills enhance consistency but do not replace clear instructions.  
  - Governance and version control are crucial to manage updates and permissions.  
  - Licensing and portability require attention for compliance and cross-platform use.  

- **Implementation Steps:**  
  1. Enable Skills and file/code features in Claude.  
  2. Identify a repetitive, high-impact workflow for your first skill.  
  3. Create a simple skill with clear instructions and minimal reference files.  
  4. Pilot with a small team and refine based on accuracy and time saved.  
  5. Standardize, assign owners, and scale skills organization-wide.

- **Business Impact:**  
  - At $25/user/month, just two hours saved per month per employee covers the cost.  
  - Main value comes from repeatability, quality improvements, and fewer reworks.  
  - “Teach it once. Get the same quality every time.”
