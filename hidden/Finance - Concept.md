## Revenue Metrics

**Revenue** represents the total amount of money a company generates from selling its products or services before any deductions. For example, if a clothing retailer sells 1,000 shirts at $50 each, their revenue is $50,000. **Revenue Y/Y Growth %** measures how much sales have increased or decreased compared to the same period last year. If last year's revenue was $40,000 and this year is $50,000, the Y/Y growth is 25%.[finally+1](https://finally.com/blog/accounting/how-to-read-income-statement/)​

## Cost and Profit Analysis

**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** includes all direct costs involved in producing the goods sold. Using our clothing example: if the retailer paid $20 per shirt for materials and direct labor, COGS would be $20,000 (1,000 shirts × $20). **COGS as a % of Revenue** shows production efficiency - in this case, 40% ($20,000 ÷ $50,000).[finaleinventory+3](https://www.finaleinventory.com/accounting-and-inventory-software/cost-of-goods-sold-formula)​

**Gross Profit** equals Revenue minus COGS, showing profit after direct production costs. In our example: $50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000 gross profit. **Gross Profit as a % of Revenue** (gross margin) indicates pricing power and production efficiency - here, 60%.[investopedia+3](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/031015/what-difference-between-gross-profit-operating-profit-and-net-income.asp)​

## Operating Expenses

**Research & Development (R&D)** expenses include costs for developing new products, software development, patents, and innovation activities. Amazon spent $73.21 billion on R&D in 2022, representing significant investment in new technologies and services. **R&D as a % of Revenue** helps assess innovation investment - tech companies typically spend 10-30% of revenue on R&D.[wikipedia+3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_companies_by_research_and_development_spending)​

**Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A)** expenses cover all overhead costs not directly tied to production. This includes sales salaries, marketing, rent, utilities, and administrative staff costs. If a company spends $10,000 on office rent, $5,000 on marketing, and $8,000 on administrative salaries monthly, monthly SG&A is $23,000.[quarterchart+3](https://quarterchart.com/financial-insight/selling-general-and-administrative-expenses)​

**Acquisition Termination Costs** are fees paid when merger deals fall through. These typically range from 2-3% of deal value. If a $1 billion acquisition fails and requires a $25 million termination fee, that's 2.5% of deal value.[hl+3](https://cdn.hl.com/pdf/2025/2024-transaction-termination-fee-study.pdf)​

## Profitability Metrics

**EBITDA** (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization) measures operational cash generation by excluding non-cash expenses and financing decisions. If a company has $50,000 gross profit, $20,000 operating expenses, $3,000 depreciation, they have $30,000 EBITDA. **EBITDA Margin %** shows operational efficiency as a percentage of revenue.[einvestingforbeginners+1](https://einvestingforbeginners.com/understanding-ebt-ebit-and-ebitda-daah/)​

**Depreciation & Amortization** represent the decline in value of physical assets (depreciation) and intangible assets (amortization). If equipment costs $100,000 with 10-year life, annual straight-line depreciation is $10,000.[wallstreetprep+3](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/depreciation-vs-amortization/)​

**EBIT** (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) equals EBITDA minus Depreciation & Amortization, showing operating profit. Using our example: $30,000 EBITDA - $3,000 depreciation = $27,000 EBIT.[365financialanalyst+2](https://365financialanalyst.com/knowledge-hub/accounting/ebitdar-vs-ebitda-vs-ebita-vs-ebit-vs-ebt-vs-ebiat-vs-adjusted-ebitda/)​

## Financial and Tax Metrics

**Interest Income** comes from investments and cash deposits, while **Interest Expense** represents borrowing costs. **Other Income/Expense** includes non-operating items like asset sales or one-time charges.[investopedia+1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp)​

**EBT** (Earnings Before Tax) shows profit before tax impact. If EBIT is $27,000, interest income is $1,000, and interest expense is $3,000, EBT equals $25,000.[investopedia+2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp)​

**Provision for Income Tax** is the estimated tax liability. With EBT of $25,000 and 25% tax rate, tax provision is $6,250. **All-in Effective Tax Rate %** shows actual tax burden: $6,250 ÷ $25,000 = 25%.[finally+1](https://finally.com/blog/accounting/how-to-read-income-statement/)​

**Net Income** is the final profit after all expenses: $25,000 EBT - $6,250 taxes = $18,750.[investopedia+2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/incomestatement.asp)​

## Per-Share Metrics

**Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS)** divides net income by outstanding common shares. With $18,750 net income and 1,000 shares outstanding: $18.75 per share.[wallstreetprep+3](https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/diluted-eps-earnings-per-share/)​

**Diluted EPS** includes potential shares from stock options and convertible securities. If 200 additional shares could be issued from options, diluted EPS is $18,750 ÷ 1,200 = $15.63.[investopedia+3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dilutedeps.asp)​

**Weighted Average Shares** accounts for shares outstanding throughout the reporting period, with basic counting current shares and diluted including potential future shares.[td+2](https://www.td.com/ca/en/investing/direct-investing/articles/eps)​

These metrics work together to provide a comprehensive view of company performance, helping investors, managers, and analysts understand operational efficiency, profitability trends, and financial health.[schwab+3](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/3-financial-statements-to-measure-companys-strength)​
