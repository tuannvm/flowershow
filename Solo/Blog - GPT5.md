Recently, there's been news about the highly anticipated release of GPT-5. However, after a few days to a week, user and community feedback hasn't been overwhelmingly positive. Some users feel a strong attachment to, or miss, the personality of GPT-4o.

Furthermore, some users report that optimizations and prompts they previously prepared for GPT-4o are no longer effective, requiring them to start over, which they find frustrating. This situation presents a challenge for early adopters and those familiar with GPT-4o who wish to leverage their existing workflows.

In addition, the capacity constraint of GPT-5 appears to be the  significant issue. We've observed considerably worse performance compared to GPT-4.1, likely due to high demand for the new model's inference, although it could also stem from the new model's serving architecture.

Previously, there were separate models for reasoning and for general purposes, but now there's just GPT-5, which might handle everything, along with internal routing to distribute requests as needed.

Given the rising community expectations, particularly from advanced users, fueled by significant AI hype, GenAI providers introducing new features will face a challenging path ahead in a market that is no longer a greenfield. There's a growing demand for AI solutions that tackle real-world problems, alleviate pain points, and deliver tangible value, rather than just focusing on science fiction concepts.

Keeping this in mind, my team at Liftoff is adopting a holistic approach by avoiding over-reliance on any single tool, model, or provider. Our main goal is to move quickly, unlock value, and establish our presence through practical implementation and a pragmatic mindset. Therefore, I'm very excited about the future of AI at Liftoff.

Based on my work, my team's efforts, and our future plans, there are numerous possibilities. We are already using AI for ticket creation, integrating it into our observability stack, and incorporating it into platform engineering. If you're interested in working with fast-paced technology, pushing boundaries, and consistently demonstrating your skills through high-quality work and practical application, we encourage you to join us.
